# Breakout Challenge

The goal was to create a playable version of the Wozniak's classic game Breakout.

We added following Features:

1. Created the blocks
1. Created the paddle, making it move with arrow keys. (look into pygame.key)
    - https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html
1. Created the ball, getting it to bounce off of the walls.
1. Checked for a collision and change block color, no reflection or destruction yet. (investigate pygame.Rect methods)
    - https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html
1. Handled the ball's reflection on collision, against both paddle and blocks.
1. Handled losing and winning.

## Bonus Features:

- Multiple lives
- Sounds
- "Edges" of the paddle
- Acceleration to increase the challenge
- High Score tracking
- Power-ups
