# Breakout Challenge

The goal was to create a playable version of the Wozniak's classic game Breakout.

We built this game on pygames and added following features:

1. Responsive UI blocks for Breakout Challenge.
2. Paddle, making it move with arrow keys.
    - https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html
3. Boucing ball, getting it to bounce off of the walls.
4. Checked for a collision and change block color, no reflection or destruction yet. (investigate pygame.Rect methods)
    - https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html
5. Handled the ball's reflection on collision, against both paddle and blocks.
6. Handled losing and winning scenarios.

## Bonus Features:s

- Multiple lives
- Sounds
- "Edges" of the paddle
- Acceleration to increase the challenge
- High Score tracking
- Power-ups
